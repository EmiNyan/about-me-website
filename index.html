    <h1>Emi Haruka</h1>
    <p>Emi Haruka is a nekomimi. That's all that will be here for now until more is required.</p>
   
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Emi was born into slavery, her parents serving a rich CEO who designed military training software for the JGSDF. She is of pure neko blood, however, her master opting not to use his slaves sexually, and so her father and mother were free to breed with one another during the slight downtime that they were allowed. When she was born, she was granted a grace period of time to learn how to walk, talk, and obey commands. After she turned four, however, she was put to work as a housemaid.

At the age of seven, a law was passed banning widespread slavery of Nekomimi and as such, she and her parents were released from custody of their owner, and as a way of thanking them for their service and to apologize, their owner granted her parents a sub-division of the company he owned to make a living off of, and personally paid for the education that Emi still required. </p>
    
    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Currently, Emi lives in a School dorm room by herself. It has a functional kitchen, and bathroom, and naturally a bedroom, but none of it is expansive, all of it being tightly compact into just a few square feet. As for a shower, those are communal and have to be shared on a per floor basis. Whenever she has time off from school, she works part time shifts down at a local cafe and coffee shop. While the slavery of nekomimi might be outlawed, she still feels the prejudices and racism coming down on her, from customers not allowing her to serve or wait on them, to being paid less than half of what other employees she works with get paid. </p>
   
    <h2>Physical Description</h2>
    <p>At age sixteen, Emi is a fairly small girl, especially in terms of human standards, but is about average for a neko, standing at 4’5’’ and being quite thin, weighing only 100 pounds. She has jet black hair that hangs down just below her waist, that over the years she has grown more and more fond of keeping messy, rarely pulling it back except for when she needs to. Born with green eyes from her father's side, they slowly changed until they were the bright yellow from her mother's side that they are currently, her right eye seeming to change in tone slightly depending on the lighting from a darker yellowish green to a vibrant yellow. Her left eye has been crippled thanks to a sword accident, and she now wears an eyepatch over top of it, the color changing depending on the day of the week.

Her wardrobe consists of mostly skirts, vests, and blouses, some for her school uniform and others not. However, whenever she is working, the skirts are replaced by a pair of black skinny jeans with a white, off-shoulder t-shirt with the coffee company’s logo on the front. </p>
    
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>Emi fancies herself a musician, playing guitar, to pass the time, but that seems to be only when the internet in her dorm is out. Otherwise, she finds herself entrapped behind a screen, watching the latest episode of an anime that she is following, or playing a free to play MMO that most of her “real” friends reside on, the ones that she lies to about her race so as to avoid any comments about why she might be playing poorly. She's also quite fond of anime, and as a result, often finds herself curling up on her bed whenever the weather is rainy or cold, watching season upon season until she realizes that she spent most of the day doing so. Whenever she isn’t sitting inside of her dorm, however, and instead is out on the town, she fancies bike riding even if it might be slower than taking the public transport to where she needs to go.

Just like all felines, however, she finds herself hesitant around water, not able to dive right in, and having to dip her toes or fingers in quite a few times before finally deciding whether or not she's interested. Milk and fish are also high on her preference lists, often times eating enough to have her laying on her back, groaning in pain from how much she ate.

At school, she excels in classes where a group effort is not needed. Japanese, English, Maths, and any computer based courses. But as soon as a classroom lab or group project arises, she often only just scrapes by, the social tension she feels making her run fleeing nose first into a book of some sort. </p>
    
    <h2>Setting</h2>
    <p>Emi’s setting can be just about anything, however, I prefer to play her in a sort of Post-Modern Urban Fantasy setting, sort of like Shadowrun, where magic is capable of prospering and multiple humanoid races flourish. Cybernetic limbs and enhancements are uncommon, however, but not unheard of, usually only the rich or lucky being able to afford them. </p>
